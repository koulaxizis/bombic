We decided to give you with the game also editor. You can completly change the game using this editor.
But it can be dangerous to use it. We recomend you to backup game data before you demage them. You use editor
at your own risk. Maps can be saved in directory maps or in the same directory as bombic.exe.
Originaly the editor was only for us, so it isn't too user friendly. When you create deathmatch map,
don't forget to set the map as deathmatch in menu->file->properties.
